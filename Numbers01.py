# So Numbers / Math in general terrifying me. No idea why but Ive never ever liked Math, even since I was at school. This section is going to be a challange. 
# This code will demonstrate Numbers and Math in general as well as giving me some great insight into the PCEP Exam math module. 

# print("If a 2000 pound pregnant hippo gives birth to a 100 pound calf,")
# print("but then eats 50 pounds of food, how much does she weigh?")
# input("Press the Enter key for the answer!")
# print("2000 - 100 + 500 =", 2000 - 100 + 50 )

# Calculation above using + and -

# print("\nIf an adventurer returns from a successful quest and each of")
# print("their 6 companions 3 bottles of ale, how many bottles are purchased?")
# print("Press Enter to find the answer!")
# print("6 * 3 =", 6 * 3 )

# Calulation above using * (Multiplication)

# print("\nIf a resturant bill comes to 19 GBP with tip, and you and")
# print("your 4 friends split the bill four ways, how much do you each pay?")
# input("Press Enter to estbalish how much is paid per person")
# print("19 / 4 =", 19 / 4)

# Calcuation above using / (division - True or Floating Point)

# print("A group of 4 pirates find a chest of 107 Gold coins and")
# print("want to divide the goal equally. How many coins does each pirate get?")
# input("Press Enter for the answer!")
# print("107 // 4 = ", 107 // 4)

# Calculation above using // (division - whole number. If I were to use / in this instancce instead, the answer would be 26.75)

print("\nIf the same group of pirates evenly divides the chest full")
print("of 107 Gold Coins, how many coins are left over?")
input("Press Enter for the answer. ")
print("107 % 4 =", 107 % 4)

# Calculation above using % (Modulous, the remainder of an integer divison expression.)

# To Recap, + is Addition, - is subtraction, / is division with a true or floating point, // is divison with an integer (full number) and % is Modulous which produces
# the remainder of an integer expression. 107 % 4 has a reaminder of 3
