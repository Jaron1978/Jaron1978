a = float(input("Enter a value for a: ")) # Prompts the user to enter a value for a
b = float(input("Enter a value for b: ")) # Prompts the user to enter a value for b

# print(a + b)  Prints the value of a + b
# print(a -50 b) Print the value of a - b
# print(a * b) Print the value of a * b
# print(a / b) Note the single /, this is because we are using floats. If we were using Integers (Whole Numbers), we would use //
