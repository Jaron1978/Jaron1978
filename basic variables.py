# In the code above, we have created a variable called name and assigned it the value of Ron. Also known as an Assignment Statement. 
# A Variable has two important rules. 
# Rule 1: A Variable name can contain only Numbers, Letters and Underderscores, 
# Rule 2: A Variable cannot start with a number. 

# Guidelines for variables
# Choose descriptive names, 
# Be consistent, 
# Follow the traditions of the language, 
# Keep the length of the variable in check. As a guideline, try to keep variables under 15 charecters.
