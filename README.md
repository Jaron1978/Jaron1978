- Hi, Im Ron and this is my GitHub repo. 
- Im currently learning Python with the intention of gaining the PCEP – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer Certification. 
- After gaining my AWS CCP in December, I am aiming to obtain my PCEP and Linux Essentials in the coming weeks / months. 
- I currently work in IT as a Desktop Support II. The objective of learning Python / Linux and other valuable skills is to enable me to move into a more Dev Ops / Net Ops focused role.
